# Blockchain
 Blockchain in python

A blockchain is essentially a "chain" of crytographically conected "blocks" of data. Generally they're used as the basis of cryptocurrencies, but they have a variety of use cases. <br>
Once entered, data is impossible to change if the blockchain is using a cryptographically secure hashing method and there are enough blocks in the chain. <br>
A blockchain is spread out over multiple computers/servers, creating redundancy and making it impossible in any practical sense to alter blocks. This is why they are called "decentralized"<br>
This decentralized nature is part of what makes cryptocurrencies work while not regulated by a higher authority. It enables peer-to-peer transactions without a trusted third-party.
